NoCopy Compiler Plugin
========================

A Kotlin compiler plugin that enables using data classes as value-based classes
 by manipulating the `copy` method.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project and apply `@NoCopy` or `@LeastVisibleCopy` to your data class.

### @NoCopy

`@NoCopy` prevents the kotlin compiler from generating the `copy` method:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // Unresolved reference
```

Now, you can do something like this and it actually makes sense:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    companion object {
        fun of(name: String, phoneNumber: String): Either<UserException, User> {
            return if (bad) {
                exception.left()
            } else {
                User(name, phoneNumber).right()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You no longer have to worry about your domain rules being broken by someone
 using the `copy` method with illegal values after an object has been instantiated.

Or you could use `@LeastVisibleCopy`.

### @LeastVisibleCopy

`@LeastVisibleCopy` modifies `copy` to mirror the visibility of the least visible constructor of the annotated class:

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

The visibility is treated in this order:

`public > internal > protected > private` 

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    private constructor(phoneNumber: String) : this("Ahmed", phoneNumber)
}
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

## Installation (not published yet)

Apply the gradle plugin:

```gradle
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.ahmedmourad.nocopy:nocopy-gradle-plugin:0.1.0"
  }  
}

apply plugin: 'com.ahmedmourad.nocopy.nocopy-gradle-plugin'
```

## Caveats

- Mirroring internal constructors is not currently supported. For now, consider using `@NoCopy` instead
 and providing your own cloning method. *(Fix planned in a future release)*
 
- For now, you cannot have methods named `copy` inside your `@NoCopy` or `@LeastVisibleCopy` annotated classes or
 they will be affected by the plugin as well. *(Fix planned in a future release)*

- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API. Compiled outputs from this plugin should be stable,
but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.

## Versions

| Kotlin Version | NoCopy Version |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| 1.3.61 | 0.1.0 (current version)

## Road Map

- Replace default data class private constructor inspection with our own
- Publish 0.1.0
- Allow adding functions named `copy` to `@NoCopy` and `@LeastVisibleCopy` annotated data classes
- Support mirroring internal constructors.
- Publish 0.1.1
- Migrate to Arrow-Meta
- Go Multiplatform
