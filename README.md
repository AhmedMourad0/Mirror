NoCopy Compiler Plugin
========================
<img src="idea-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/pluginIcon.svg" alt="" width="200" />
A Kotlin compiler plugin that enables using data classes as value-based classes
 by moderating usage of their `copy` method.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project and apply `@NoCopy` or `@LeastVisibleCopy` to your data class.

### @NoCopy

`@NoCopy` prevents the kotlin compiler from generating the `copy` method:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // Unresolved reference
```

Now, you can do something like this and it actually makes sense:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    companion object {
        fun of(name: String, phoneNumber: String): Either<UserException, User> {
            return if (bad) {
                exception.left()
            } else {
                User(name, phoneNumber).right()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You no longer have to worry about your domain rules being broken by someone
 using the `copy` method with illegal values after an object has been instantiated.

Or you could use `@LeastVisibleCopy`.

### @LeastVisibleCopy

`@LeastVisibleCopy` modifies `copy` to mirror the visibility of the least visible constructor of the annotated class:

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

The visibility is treated in this order:

`public > internal > protected > private` 

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    private constructor(phoneNumber: String) : this("Ahmed", phoneNumber)
}
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

## Installation

- In your project-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy:nocopy-gradle-plugin:0.1.0"
    }  
}
```

- In your module-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
// For each module that needs to use the annotations
apply plugin: 'dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy.nocopy-gradle-plugin'
```

- Install the IDEA plugin *`File -> Settings -> plugins -> Marketplace -> Kotlin NoCopy`*

- Disable the default inspection `File -> Settings -> Editor ->
 Inspections -> Kotlin -> Probably bugs -> Private data class constructor is...`. Currently, you have to do
 this manually due to a bug with the Kotlin plugin, [upvote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-37576).

## Caveats

- Mirroring internal constructors with `@LeastVisibleCopy` is not currently
 supported, for now, consider using `@NoCopy` instead and provide your own
 cloning method, there are inspections included that will highlight an error when you
 do this.
  
- Currently, you cannot have a method named `copy` with the same
  signature (return type included) in your `@NoCopy` annotated data
  class or you will get IDE and compiler errors. (Attempting this,
  however, can be considered a bad practice as `copy` has a very defined
  behaviour in `Kotlin`, replacing it with your own custom
  implementation can be misleading)
  
- Applying `@LeastVisibleCopy` and other compiler plugins that require access
  to the constructors of the class,
  eg. [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization),
  to the same class will cause your build to fail with this error: 
  ```
  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Recursive call in a lazy value under LockBasedStorageManager@38d56162 (TopDownAnalyzer for JVM)
  ```
  this's due to the current limitations of the compiler plugins API that causes
  these plugins to call each other recursively, [upvote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-39491).
 
- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API. Compiled outputs from this plugin should be stable,
 but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.

## Versions

| Kotlin Version | NoCopy Version |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| 1.3.72 | 0.1.0

## Roadmap

- Support mirroring internal constructors.
- Support having `copy` named methods in `@NoCopy` annotated data classes.
- Testing.
- Migrate to Arrow-Meta.
- Go Multiplatform.
- Add annotation to convert regular classes to value-based classes
- Move to Kotlin DSL for Gradle build scripts
