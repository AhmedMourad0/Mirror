========================
<img src="plugins/idea-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/pluginIcon.svg" alt="" width="200" />
A Kotlin compiler plugin that removes the `copy` method from data classes
 and enables using them as value-based classes.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project and apply `@NoCopy` to your data class.

### @NoCopy

`@NoCopy` prevents the kotlin compiler from generating the `copy` method:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // Unresolved reference: copy
```

## Why? I hear you ask.

The `copy` method of Kotlin data classes is a known language design problem, normally, you can't
remove it, you can't override it, and you can document it.

Why would you want to do that? Well, there are a couple of reasons:

- `copy` is a guaranteed source of binary incompatibility as you add new properties to the type when
 all you wanted was value semantics.
- If you want [value-based classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html),
 `copy` will break your constructor invariants.
- Private constructors are basically meaningless as long as `copy` exists.

Consider something like this:

```kotlin
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    companion object {
        fun of(name: String, phoneNumber: String): Either<UserException, User> {
            return if (bad) {
                exception.left() //You can throw an exception here if you like instead.
            } else {
                User(name, phoneNumber).right()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
It would look like all instances of `User` must be valid and can't `bad`, right?

Wrong:
```kotlin
User.of("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Gotcha")
```
`copy` can bypass all the validations of your data class, it breaks your domain rules!
 
There are a couple of interesting discussions on the subject,
 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hjoyxx/nocopy_compiler_plugin_for_kotlin/)
 and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/hj3yq8/nocopy_compiler_plugin_for_kotlin/).

## Installation

- In your project-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy:nocopy-gradle-plugin:1.4.0"
    }  
}
```

- In your module-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
// For each module that needs to use the annotations
apply plugin: 'dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy.nocopy-gradle-plugin'
```

- Install the IDEA plugin *`File -> Settings -> plugins -> Marketplace -> Kotlin NoCopy`*

- Disable the default inspection `File -> Settings -> Editor ->
 Inspections -> Kotlin -> Probably bugs -> Private data class constructor is...`. Currently, you have to do
 this manually due to a bug with the Kotlin plugin, [upvote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-37576).

## Caveats

- Currently, you cannot have a method named `copy` with the same
  signature (return type included) in your `@NoCopy` annotated data
  class or you will get IDE and compiler errors. (Attempting this,
  however, can be considered a bad practice as `copy` has a very defined
  behaviour in `Kotlin`, replacing it with your own custom
  implementation can be misleading)
  
- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API. Compiled outputs from this plugin should be stable,
 but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.
