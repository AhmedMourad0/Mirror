NoCopy Compiler Plugin
========================

![Icon](idea-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/pluginIcon.svg)

A Kotlin compiler plugin that enables using data classes as value-based classes
 by manipulating the `copy` method.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project and apply `@NoCopy` or `@LeastVisibleCopy` to your data class.

### @NoCopy

`@NoCopy` prevents the kotlin compiler from generating the `copy` method:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // Unresolved reference
```

Now, you can do something like this and it actually makes sense:

```kotlin
@NoCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    companion object {
        fun of(name: String, phoneNumber: String): Either<UserException, User> {
            return if (bad) {
                exception.left()
            } else {
                User(name, phoneNumber).right()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You no longer have to worry about your domain rules being broken by someone
 using the `copy` method with illegal values after an object has been instantiated.

Or you could use `@LeastVisibleCopy`.

### @LeastVisibleCopy

`@LeastVisibleCopy` modifies `copy` to mirror the visibility of the least visible constructor of the annotated class:

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

The visibility is treated in this order:

`public > internal > protected > private` 

```kotlin
@LeastVisibleCopy
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    private constructor(phoneNumber: String) : this("Ahmed", phoneNumber)
}
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

## Installation

- In your project-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy:nocopy-gradle-plugin:0.1.0"
    }  
}
```

- In your module-level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
// For each module that needs to use the annotations
apply plugin: 'dev.ahmedmourad.nocopy.nocopy-gradle-plugin'
```

- Install the IDEA plugin *`File -> Settings -> plugins -> Marketplace -> Kotlin NoCopy`*

- Disable the default inspection `File -> Settings -> Editor ->
 Inspections -> Kotlin -> Probably bugs -> Private data class constructor is...`. Currently, you have to do
  this manually due to a bug with the Kotlin plugin, [upvote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-37576).

## Caveats

- Mirroring internal constructors is not currently supported. For now, consider using `@NoCopy` instead
 and providing your own cloning method, there are inspections included that will give you an error when you
  do this. *(Fix planned in a future release)*
  
- For now, you cannot have methods named `copy` with the same signature (return type included) in
 your `@NoCopy` annotated data class or you will get ide and compiler errors. *(Fix planned in a future release)*
 
- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API. Compiled outputs from this plugin should be stable,
 but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.

## Versions

| Kotlin Version | NoCopy Version |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| 1.3.72 | 0.1.0

## Roadmap

- Support mirroring internal constructors.
- Support having `copy` named methods in `@NoCopy` annotated data classes.
- Migrate to Arrow-Meta.
- Auto install IDEA plugin.
- Go Multiplatform.
- Add annotation to convert regular classes to value-based classes
- Move to Kotlin DSL for Gradle build scripts
