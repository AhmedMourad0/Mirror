mirror-compiler-plugin
========================

A Kotlin compiler plugin that facilitates using data classes as value-based classes
 by manipulating the `copy` method.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project and apply `@Shatter` or `@Mirror` to your data class.

### @Shatter

Shatter stops the kotlin compiler from generating the `copy` method.

```kotlin
@Shatter
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

Then you can do something like this and it actually makes sense:

```kotlin
@Shatter
data class User private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    companion object {
        fun of(name: String, phoneNumber: String): Either<UserException, User> {
            return if (bad) {
                exception.left()
            } else {
                User(name, phoneNumber).right()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now you don't have to worry about your domain rules being broken by someone
 using the `copy` method with illegal values after the user object has been created:

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // Unresolved reference
```

Or you can use `@Mirror`.

### @Mirror

Mirror modifies `copy` to mirror the visibility of the annotated constructor:

```kotlin
data class User @Mirror private constructor(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String)
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

Annotating a class with `@Mirror` means that `copy` will mirror
 the visibility of the least visible constructor where visibility is treated in this order:

`public > internal > protected > private` 

```kotlin
@Mirror
data class User(val name: String, val phoneNumber: String) {
    private constructor(phoneNumber: String) : this("Ahmed", phoneNumber)
}
```

```kotlin
User("Ahmed", "+201234567890").copy(phoneNumber = "Happy birthday!") // copy is private in User
```

However, mirroring internal constructors is not currently support, for now, consider
 using `@Shatter` instead and provide your own `copy` method.

## Installation (not published yet)

Apply the gradle plugin.

```gradle
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.ahmedmourad.mirror:mirror-compiler-plugin-gradle:0.0.1"
  }  
}

apply plugin: 'com.ahmedmourad.mirror.mirror-gradle-plugin'
```

The default configuration will add the `-annotations` artifact (which has
 the `@Mirror` and `@Shatter` annotations) 
You can configure custom behavior with properties on the `mirror` extension.

```
mirror {
  // Define custom annotations. The -annotations artifact won't be automatically added to
  // dependencies if you define your own.
  shatterAnnotation = "com.ahmedmourad.mirror.annotations.Shatter" // Default
  mirrorAnnotation = "com.ahmedmourad.mirror.annotations.Mirror" // Default

  resolution = "byAnnotations" // shatterAll, mirrorAllByLeastVisible, mirrorAllByPrimary
}
```

You can use resolution to choose how the plugin behaves:

| Resolution | Behaviour |
| :--------- | :---------|
| byAnnotations | The plugin will only mirror or shatter `copy` of the data classes marked with specified annotations. |
| shatterAll | The plugin will shatter all `copy` methods of all data classes (no annotations needed). |
| mirrorAllByLeastVisible | The plugin will mirror the least visible constructor for all copy methods of all data classes (no annotations needed). |
| mirrorAllByPrimary | The plugin will mirror the primary constructor for all copy methods of all data classes (no annotations needed). |


## Caveats

- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API. Compiled outputs from this plugin should be stable,
but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.

## Versions

| Kotlin Version | Mirror Version |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| 1.3.61 | 0.0.1 (current version)

## Road Map

- Add IDE plugin.
- Support mirroring internal constructors.
- Support Maven.
